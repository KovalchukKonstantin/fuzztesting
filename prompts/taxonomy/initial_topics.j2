Product: "Food delivery marketplace"
Topics: ["Restaurant Search & Filtering", "Order Placement", "Payment Processing", "Real-time Delivery Tracking", "Rating & Reviews", "Promotions & Discounts"]

Product: "Video conferencing platform"
Topics: ["Meeting Creation & Scheduling", "Audio/Video Quality", "Screen Sharing", "Chat & Reactions", "Recording & Playback", "Participant Management"]

Now generate topics for the product described above.

Respond with a JSON array of strings:
